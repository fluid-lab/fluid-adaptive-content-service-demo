# What Is This

A very basic front-end demo of  [fluid-adaptive-content-service](https://github.com/fluid-lab/fluid-adaptive-content-service), a 2018 GSoC project worked on by [Kunal Mohta](https://github.com/kunal-mohta/).

# Running It

(assuming you're running the adaptive content service with `npm start` already, with standard defaults)

- `npm install`
- run a static webserver in the root directory of this project using [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or similar
- visit the index.html file
